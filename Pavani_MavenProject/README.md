# Market Maven Project

## Overview

This project is part of the MARKET MAVEN INFOSYS INTERNSHIP (October 2024) and is maintained under the repository [SpringBoardMentor193s/MARKET\_MAVEN\_INFOSYS\_INTERNSHIP\_OCT2024](https://github.com/SpringBoardMentor193s/MARKET_MAVEN_INFOSYS_INTERNSHIP_OCT2024). It includes a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing supermarket sales and generating predictions.

## Features

- **Sales Data Analysis**: Processes the `supermarket_sales.csv` dataset to perform detailed analysis.
- **Prediction Generation**: Outputs a predictions file, `predictions.csv`, with forecasted sales insights.
- **Modular Design**: Built for scalability and ease of use.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: 3.8+
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn (see `requirements.txt` for complete list)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpringBoardMentor193s/MARKET_MAVEN_INFOSYS_INTERNSHIP_OCT2024.git
cd MARKET_MAVEN_INFOSYS_INTERNSHIP_OCT2024/Pavani_MavenProject
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Pavani_MarketMaven.ipynb`:

```bash
jupyter notebook Pavani_MarketMaven.ipynb
```

### 4. Dataset and Output

- Place the dataset `supermarket_sales.csv` in the project directory.
- Execute the notebook cells to process the dataset and generate predictions.
- The predictions will be saved as `predictions.csv` in the project directory.


## Usage

1. Update the dataset (`supermarket_sales.csv`) as needed.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to analyze the data and generate predictions.
3. Use the `predictions.csv` output for further insights or integrations.
